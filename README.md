# MITBeerGame
My own implementation of the MIT beer game.

## About

The Beer Distribution Game, one of the oldest and most widely used management simulations, is a game used to explore and, in many cases, teach about  distribution management.

The Wikipedia article is a good starting point: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_distribution_game

## This Implementation

This implementation will use SignalR on a C# backend to handle the game logic, and a React UI to allow users to play.
